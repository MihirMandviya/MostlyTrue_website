PROBLEM DEFINATION:

Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership.
 The news often reverberates as misinformation in social media but occasionally finds its way to the mainstream media as well. On the other hand, it may also involve narration of a true fact however being deliberately exaggerated. This may also include titling the web pages with misleading titles or taglines in order to seize the attention of readers.
 Such misinformation may lead to committing offences, social unrest, financial frauds upon such misrepresentation, political gain, to increase the number of readers, gain revenue associated with clickbait, etc. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society.

NEED OF SYSTEM:

As an increasing amount of our lives is spent interacting online through social media platforms, more and more people tend to hunt out and consume news from social media instead of traditional news organizations.[1] The explanations for this alteration in consumption behaviours are inherent within the nature of those social media platforms: (i) it's often more timely and less expensive to consume news on social media compared with traditional journalism, like newspapers or television; and (ii) it's easier to further share, discuss, and discuss the news with friends or other readers on social media.

Despite the benefits provided by social media, the standard of stories on social media is less than traditional news organizations. However, because it's inexpensive to supply news online and far faster and easier to propagate through social media, large volumes of faux news, i.e., those news articles with intentionally false information, are produced online for a spread of purposes, like financial and political gain.
Given the prevalence of this new phenomenon, â€œFake news" was even named the word of the year by the Macquarie Dictionary in 2016. Hence there is a need for a system that will check if given news is real or not. So, we have made a fake news detection model which detects the reality of the news.
